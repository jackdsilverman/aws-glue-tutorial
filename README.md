# AWS Glue Tutorial

In this presentation, we will show how you can go through the entire ETL/BI process all with AWS, and save money by using it. We will be using Glue, a fully managed, serverless, and cloud-optimized ETL service made for developers. And Amazon Quicksight, a BI service integrated with your loaded data, which provides data analysis and insight. During this handsÂ­-on workshop, you will build an ETL service utilizing AWS services such as Glue, Redshift, S3, Athena and Quicksight.
